## Common Pepr Policies for UDS Core

Thess policies are based on the [Big Bang](https://p1.dso.mil/services/big-bang) policies created with Kyverno. You can find the source policies [here](https://repo1.dso.mil/big-bang/product/packages/kyverno-policies).

Exemptions are specified in the [exemptions](./exemptions/index.ts) folder and are only applied if the specific Validate Action permits exemptions. These take the place of Kyverno Exceptions.
