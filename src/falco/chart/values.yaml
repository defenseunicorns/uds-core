# Falco rules that are disabled by default in UDS as they tend to generate a lot of noise
udsDefaultDisabledRules:
  - "Change thread namespace" # Ztunnel generates a lot of this noise for this rule
  - "Contact EC2 Instance Metadata Service From Container" # This generates noise in AWS environments where IMDS is used
  - "Contact cloud metadata service from container" # This generates noise in cloud environments where metadata services are used
  - "Contact K8S API Server From Container" # This generates noise in UDS Core and is expected behavior
