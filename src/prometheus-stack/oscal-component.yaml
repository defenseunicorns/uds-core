                Log the execution of privileged functions.

                # Control Implementation
                Privileged events, including updating the deployment of an application, or use of privileged containers are collected as metrics by prometheus and displayed by Grafana.

              remarks: This control is fully implemented by this tool.

                # Control Description
                "a. Identify the types of events that the system is capable of logging in support of the audit function: [Assignment: successful and unsuccessful account logon events, account management events, object access, policy change, privilege functions, process tracking, and system events. For Web applications: all administrator activity, authentication checks, authorization checks, data deletions, data access, data changes, and permission changes];
                b. Coordinate the event logging function with other organizational entities requiring audit-related information to guide and inform the selection criteria for events to be logged;
                c. Specify the following event types for logging within the system: [Assignment: organization-defined subset of the auditable events defined in AU-2a to be audited continually for each identified event.) along with the frequency of (or situation requiring) logging for each identified event type];
                d. Provide a rationale for why the event types selected for logging are deemed to be adequate to support after-the-fact investigations of incidents; and
                e. Review and update the event types selected for logging [Assignment: annually or whenever there is a change in the threat environment]."

                # Control Implementation
                API endpoints suitable for capturing application level metrics are present on each of the supported applications running as containers.
                In addition, system and cluster level metrics are emitted by containers with read only access to host level information.
                Metrics are captured and stored by Prometheus, an web server capable of scraping endpoints formatted in the appropriate dimensional data format.
                Metrics information is stored on disk in a time series data base, and later queried through a separate component providing a web interface for the query language: PromQL.

                # Control Implementation
                Prometheus is the log aggregator for audit logs since it is used to scrape/collect violations from ClusterAuditor.
                The storage capability can be configured in prometheus to use PVCs to ensure metrics have log retention compliance with the org-defined audit-log retention requirements.

                # Control Implementation
                Alertmanager has pre-built alerts for PVC storage thresholds that would fire for PVCs supporting prometheus metrics storage.

                # Control Implementation
                Alertmanager has pre-build alerts for failed pods that would show when ClusterAuditor is not processing events, or prometheus is unable to scrape events.
                Prometheus also has a deadman's alert to ensure end users are seeing events from prometheus as part of its configuration.

                Cluster Auditor Events/Alerts could be exported from Prometheus to an external system. Integration for specific tooling would need to be completed by end user.

                # Control Implementation
                Aggregating cluster auditor events across multiple sources (clusters) is possible with a multi-cluster deployment of prometheus/grafana.

                # Control Implementation
                Cluster Auditor's audit data is consolidated with system monitoring tooling (node exporters) for consolidated view to enhance inappropriate or unusual activity.

                # Control Implementation
                Cluster Auditor data in prometheus would enable this, but would require prometheus to also obtain access to physical metrics.

                # Control Implementation
                Prometheus stores all data as time-series data, so the timestamps of when those violations were present is part of the data-stream.

                # Control Implementation
                Prometheus can scrape external components outside of the system, but this configuration is not easily supported as part of
                the current UDS Coreg configuration of ClusterAuditor since external access to ClusterAuditor metrics is not exposed via Istio.
