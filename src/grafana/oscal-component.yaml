                # Control Description
                Log the execution of privileged functions.

                # Control Implementation
                Privileged events, including updating the deployment of an application, or use of privileged containers are collected as metrics by prometheus and displayed by Grafana.

              remarks: This control is fully implemented by this tool.

                # Control Description
                a. Identify the types of events that the system is capable of logging in support of the audit function: [Assignment: successful and unsuccessful account logon events, account management events, object access, policy change, privilege functions, process tracking, and system events. For Web applications: all administrator activity, authentication checks, authorization checks, data deletions, data access, data changes, and permission changes];
                b. Coordinate the event logging function with other organizational entities requiring audit-related information to guide and inform the selection criteria for events to be logged;
                c. Specify the following event types for logging within the system: [Assignment: organization-defined event types (subset of the event types defined in AU-2a.) along with the frequency of (or situation requiring) logging for each identified event type];
                d. Provide a rationale for why the event types selected for logging are deemed to be adequate to support after-the-fact investigations of incidents; and
                e. Review and update the event types selected for logging [Assignment: annually or whenever there is a change in the threat environment].

                # Control Implementation
                API endpoints suitable for capturing application level metrics are present on each of the supported applications running as containers.
                In addition, system and cluster level metrics are emitted by containers with read only access to host level information.
                Metrics are captured and stored by Prometheus, an web server capable of scraping endpoints formatted in the appropriate dimensional data format.
                Metrics information is stored on disk in a time series data base, and later queried through a separate component providing a web interface for the query language: PromQL.
                Metrics data can be displayed through a Grafana dashboard for visualization.

                or identify the event; characteristics that describe or identify the object or resource being acted upon; individual identities of group account users; full-text of privileged commands].

                # Control Implementation
                Grafana has pre-configured dashboards showing the audit records from Cluster Auditor saved in Prometheus.

                # Control Implementation
                Alertmanager has pre-built alerts for PVC storage thresholds that would fire for PVCs supporting prometheus metrics storage.

                # Control Implementation
                Alertmanager has pre-built alerts for failed pods that would show when ClusterAuditor is not processing events, or prometheus is unable to scrape events.
                Prometheus also has a deadman's alert to ensure end users are seeing events from prometheus as part of its configuration.

                # Control Implementation
                Cluster Auditor Events/Alerts could be exported from Prometheus to an external system. Integration for specific tooling would need to be completed by end user.

                # Control Implementation
                Aggregating cluster auditor events across multiple sources (clusters) is possible with a multi-cluster deployment of prometheus/grafana.

                # Control Implementation
                Cluster Auditor's audit data is consolidated with system monitoring tooling (node exporters) for consolidated view to enhance inappropriate or unusual activity.
                Metrics data can be displayed through a Grafana dashboard for visualization.

                # Control Implementation
                Cluster Auditor data in prometheus would enable this, but would require prometheus to also obtain access to physical metrics.

                a. Supports on-demand audit record review, analysis, and reporting requirements and after-the-fact investigations of incidents; and
                b. Does not alter the original content or time ordering of audit records.

                # Control Implementation
                Grafana is configured with a pre-built dashboard for policy violations that displays data collected by Cluster Auditor.

                a. Use internal system clocks to generate time stamps for audit records; and
                b. Record time stamps for audit records that meet [Assignment: one second granularity of time measurement] and that use Coordinated Universal Time, have a fixed local time offset
                from Coordinated Universal Time, or that include the local time offset as part of the time stamp.

                # Control Implementation
                Prometheus stores all data as time-series data, so the timestamps of when those violations were present is part of the data-stream.

                b. Alert [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] upon detection of unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of audit information.

                # Control Implementation
                Grafana has the ability to provide Role Based Access Control to limit the data sources that end users can view by leveraging an
                identity provider. Grafana can also limit users to subsets of metrics within a datasource by the use of Label Based Access Control
                when using Grafana Enterprise.

                Store audit records [Assignment: at least weekly] in a repository that is part of a physically different system or system component than the system or component being audited.

                # Control Implementation
                Prometheus can scrape external components outside of the system, but this configuration is not easily supported as part of
                the current big bang configuration of ClusterAuditor since external access to ClusterAuditor metrics is not exposed via Istio.

                Compatible metrics endpoints emitted from each application is compiled by Prometheus and displayed through Grafana with associated timestamps
                of when the data was collected.
