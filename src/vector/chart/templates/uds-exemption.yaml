      description: "Vector mounts the following hostPaths:
        - `/var/log`: to tail logs
        - `/var/lib/vector`: for Vector's buffering and persistent state
        Since logs can have sensitive information, it is better to exclude
        Vector from the policy than add the paths as allowable mounts"
