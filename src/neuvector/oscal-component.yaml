                Static code analysis provides a technology and methodology for security reviews and includes checking for weaknesses in the code as well as for the incorporation of libraries or other included code with known vulnerabilities or that are out-of-date and not supported. Static code analysis can be used to identify vulnerabilities and enforce secure coding practices. It is most effective when used early in the development process, when each code change can automatically be scanned for potential weaknesses. Static code analysis can provide clear remediation guidance and identify defects for developers to fix. Evidence of the correct implementation of static analysis can include aggregate defect density for critical defect types, evidence that defects were inspected by developers or security professionals, and evidence that defects were remediated. A high density of ignored findings, commonly referred to as false positives, indicates a potential problem with the analysis process or the analysis tool. In such cases, organizations weigh the validity of the evidence against evidence from other sources.

                "a. Monitor and control communications at the external managed interfaces to the system and at key internal managed interfaces within the system;
                b. Implement subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are [Selection: physically; logically] separated from internal organizational networks; and
                c. Connect to external networks or systems only through managed interfaces consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational security and privacy architecture."

                # Control Implementation
                NeuVector monitors all communications to external interfaces by only connecting to external networks through managed interfaces and utilizes whitelists and blacklists for rules at Layer 7.

                # Control Implementation
                Data in transit is protected using a TLS connection and secured between components within the data center using an internal certificate until it is terminated at the application node. This ensures that data in transit is encrypted using SSL.
