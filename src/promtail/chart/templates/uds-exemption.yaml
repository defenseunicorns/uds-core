      description: "Promtail mounts the following hostPaths:
        - `/var/log/pods`: to tail pod logs
        - `/var/lib/docker/containers`: to tail container logs
        - `/run/promtail`: for Promtail's buffering and persistent state
        Since logs can have sensitive information, it is better to exclude
        Promtail from the policy than add the paths as allowable mounts
