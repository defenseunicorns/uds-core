      description: |
        alloy mounts the following hostPaths:
        - `/var/log`: to tail system/pod logs
        - `/var/lib/docker/containers`: to tail container logs
        Since logs can have sensitive information, it is better to exclude
        alloy from the policy than add the paths as allowable mounts
