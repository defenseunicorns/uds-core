            # Control Description
              Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised information system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations.
              Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse, and in doing so, help mitigate the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat (APT).

            # Control Implementation
              Vector can be configured to collect all logs from Kubernetes and underlying operating systems, allowing the aggregation of privileged function calls.

            # Control Description
              An event is any observable occurrence in an organizational information system.
              Organizations identify audit events as those events which are significant and relevant to the security of information systems and the environments in which those systems operate in order to meet specific and ongoing audit needs.
              Audit events can include, for example, password changes, failed logons, or failed accesses related to information systems, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, or third-party credential usage.
              In determining the set of auditable events, organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the security controls to be implemented.
              To balance auditing requirements with other information system needs, this control also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are audited at a given point in time.

            # Control Implementation
              Logging daemons are present on each node that BigBang is installed on.  Out of the box, the following events are captured:
              * all containers emitting to STDOUT or STDERR (captured by container runtime creating containers logs under /var/log/pods).
              * all kubernetes api server requests.
              * all events emitted by the kubelet.

            # Control Description
              Time stamps generated by the information system include date and time.
              Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC.
              Granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between information system clocks and reference clocks, for example, clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or within tens of milliseconds.
              Organizations may define different time granularities for different system components.
              Time service can also be critical to other security capabilities such as access control and identification and authentication, depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities.

            # Control Implementation
              Records captured by the logging daemon are enriched to  ensure the following are always present:
              * time of the event (UTC).
              * source of event (pod, namespace, container id).
              Applications are responsible for providing all other information.

            # Control Description Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to employ static code analysis tools to identify common flaws and document the results of the analysis. Static code analysis provides a technology and methodology for security reviews and includes checking for weaknesses in the code as well as for the incorporation of libraries or other included code with known vulnerabilities or that are out-of-date and not supported. Static code analysis can be used to identify vulnerabilities and enforce secure coding practices. It is most effective when used early in the development process, when each code change can automatically be scanned for potential weaknesses. Static code analysis can provide clear remediation guidance and identify defects for developers to fix. Evidence of the correct implementation of static analysis can include aggregate defect density for critical defect types, evidence that defects were inspected by developers or security professionals, and evidence that defects were remediated. A high density of ignored findings, commonly referred to as false positives, indicates a potential problem with the analysis process or the analysis tool. In such cases, organizations weigh the validity of the evidence against evidence from other sources.

            Istio is configured to maintain separate execution domains for each executing process. This is achieved through Istio's sidecar proxy design, where each service in the mesh has its own dedicated sidecar proxy to handle its inbound and outbound traffic. This ensures that communication between processes is controlled and one process cannot modify the executing code of another process.
