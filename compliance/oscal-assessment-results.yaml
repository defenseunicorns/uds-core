            # Control Implementation
              Istio is configured to maintain separate execution domains for each executing process. This is achieved through Istio's sidecar proxy design, where each service in the mesh has its own dedicated sidecar proxy to handle its inbound and outbound traffic. This ensures that communication between processes is controlled and one process cannot modify the executing code of another process.

              Logs are captured by promtail from the node. The node logs will contain the necessary log data from all pods/applications inside the selected nodes.
              Validating `logfmt` as the config.logFormat would be the goal. This is currently a secret mounted to /etc/promtail/promtail.yaml in the promtail container. We will ensure the promtail.yaml file is at a minimum the target config.

            # Control Description
              Time stamps generated by the information system include date and time.
              Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC.
              Granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between information system clocks and reference clocks, for example, clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or within tens of milliseconds.
              Organizations may define different time granularities for different system components.
              Time service can also be critical to other security capabilities such as access control and identification and authentication, depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities.

            # Control Implementation
              Records captured by the logging daemon are enriched to  ensure the following are always present:
              * time of the event (UTC).
              * source of event (pod, namespace, container id).
              Applications are responsible for providing all other information.
              Validating `logfmt` as the config.logFormat would be the goal. This is currently a secret mounted to /etc/promtail/promtail.yaml in the promtail container. We will ensure the promtail.yaml file is at a minimum the target config.

            # Control Description Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to employ static code analysis tools to identify common flaws and document the results of the analysis. Static code analysis provides a technology and methodology for security reviews and includes checking for weaknesses in the code as well as for the incorporation of libraries or other included code with known vulnerabilities or that are out-of-date and not supported. Static code analysis can be used to identify vulnerabilities and enforce secure coding practices. It is most effective when used early in the development process, when each code change can automatically be scanned for potential weaknesses. Static code analysis can provide clear remediation guidance and identify defects for developers to fix. Evidence of the correct implementation of static analysis can include aggregate defect density for critical defect types, evidence that defects were inspected by developers or security professionals, and evidence that defects were remediated. A high density of ignored findings, commonly referred to as false positives, indicates a potential problem with the analysis process or the analysis tool. In such cases, organizations weigh the validity of the evidence against evidence from other sources.
