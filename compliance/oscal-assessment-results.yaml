            # Control Description Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to employ static code analysis tools to identify common flaws and document the results of the analysis. Static code analysis provides a technology and methodology for security reviews and includes checking for weaknesses in the code as well as for the incorporation of libraries or other included code with known vulnerabilities or that are out-of-date and not supported. Static code analysis can be used to identify vulnerabilities and enforce secure coding practices. It is most effective when used early in the development process, when each code change can automatically be scanned for potential weaknesses. Static code analysis can provide clear remediation guidance and identify defects for developers to fix. Evidence of the correct implementation of static analysis can include aggregate defect density for critical defect types, evidence that defects were inspected by developers or security professionals, and evidence that defects were remediated. A high density of ignored findings, commonly referred to as false positives, indicates a potential problem with the analysis process or the analysis tool. In such cases, organizations weigh the validity of the evidence against evidence from other sources.

              Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control, includes, for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked.
              Event outcomes can include indicators of event success or failure and event-specific results (e.g., the security state of the information system after the event occurred).

              Logs are captured by promtail from the node. The node logs will contain the necessary log data from all pods/applications inside the selected nodes.
              Validating `logfmt` as the config.logFormat would be the goal. This is currently a secret mounted to /etc/promtail/promtail.yaml in the promtail container. We will ensure the promtail.yaml file is at a minimum the target config.

            # Control Implementation API endpoints suitable for capturing application level metrics are present on each of the supported applications running as containers. In addition, system and cluster level metrics are emitted by containers with read only access to host level information. Metrics are captured and stored by Prometheus, an web server capable of scraping endpoints formatted in the appropriate dimensional data format. Metrics information is stored on disk in a time series data base, and later queried through a separate component providing a web interface for the query language: PromQL. Metrics data can be displayed through a Grafana dashboard for visualization.

              Istio is configured to maintain separate execution domains for each executing process. This is achieved through Istio's sidecar proxy design, where each service in the mesh has its own dedicated sidecar proxy to handle its inbound and outbound traffic. This ensures that communication between processes is controlled and one process cannot modify the executing code of another process.
