# UDS Core Versioning

## Overview

This document defines the UDS Core versioning policy, specifically addressing what constitutes our API boundaries and what changes would be considered breaking changes according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) principles.

## What Constitutes the UDS Core API?

Since UDS Core is a Kubernetes based platform, rather than a traditional application or library, we don’t have a traditional API. This document defines our contract with the end user, and we refer to this as our “API” to keep with traditional SemVer wording/principles.

For versioning purposes, we consider the following to be part of our API:

### 1. Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

- Schema definitions, including all fields, their types, and validation rules
- Behavior of the UDS Operator interacting with these resources
- Required configurations and existing behavior of custom resources

### 2. UDS Core Configuration and Packaging

- UDS Core's own configuration values (config charts)
- Exposed Zarf variables and their expected behavior
- Component organization and included components in published packages

### 3. Default Security Posture

- Default networking restrictions (network policies)
- Default security integrations (service mesh configuration, runtime security)
- Default mutations and policy validations

Anything not listed here is generally not considered to be part of our public API, for example: internal implementation details, non-configurable Helm templates, test/debug utilities, and any component not exposed to the user or external automation.

## Breaking vs. Non-Breaking Changes

Any references to “public API” or “API” in the below sections assume the above definition of UDS Core’s API / Contract with the end user.

### Breaking Changes (Require Major Version Bump)

The following changes would be considered breaking changes and would require a major version bump:

- **Removal or renaming** of any field, parameter, or interface in the public API
- **Changes to behavior** of existing APIs that could cause deployments of UDS Core to function incorrectly
- **Schema changes** that make existing valid configurations invalid
- **Changing default values** in ways that alter existing behavior without explicit configuration
- **Removal of supported capabilities** previously available to users
- **Significant changes to security posture** that would require users to reconfigure their mission applications

### Examples of Breaking Changes:

1. Changing the default service mesh integration method (i.e. from sidecar to ambient mode)
2. Adding new, more restrictive default network policies that would block previously allowed traffic
3. Removing a field from the Package CRD (i.e. removing `monitor[].path`)
4. Removing/replacing a component (i.e. the tooling used for monitoring) from the published UDS Core package

### Non-Breaking Changes (Compatible with Minor or Patch Version Bumps)

The following changes are compatible with a minor version bump (new features) or patch version bump (bug fixes):

- **Adding new optional fields** to CRDs or configuration
- **Creation of a new CRD version** *without* removing the older one
- **Extending functionality** without changing existing behavior
- **Bug fixes** that restore intended behavior
- **Performance improvements** that don't alter behavior
- **Security enhancements** that don't require user reconfiguration
- **New features** that are opt-in and don't change existing defaults
- **Upstream major helm chart/application changes** that don't affect UDS Core's API contract

### Examples of Non-Breaking Changes:

1. Adding a new optional field to a CRD
2. Creating a new "v1" Package CRD without removing/changing the "v1beta1" Package CRD
3. Enhancing monitoring capabilities with new metrics
4. Adding new Istio configuration options that are off by default
5. Adding a new default NetworkPolicy to expand allowed communications
6. Upgrading an underlying application component's version without changing UDS Core's API contract
