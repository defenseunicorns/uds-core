## What is UDS Core?

UDS Core is a collection of several individual applications combined into a single Zarf Package, that establishes a secure baseline for secure cloud-native systems. It comes equipped with comprehensive compliance documentation and prioritizes seamless support for highly regulated and egress-limited environments. Building upon the achievements of Platform One, UDS Core enhances the security stance introduced by Big Bang. It introduces advanced automation through the UDS Operator and UDS Policy Engine.

UDS Core enables your team to:

- Deploy full mission environments and applications efficiently and securely.
- Leverage specific functional applications to deliver a versatile platform that caters to diverse mission objectives.
- Enhance the efficiency, security, and success of software delivery and operations process.

### Accomplishing Mission Objectives with Functional Applications

UDS leverages functional applications that are well-suited to perform the specific tasks required. These tools are carefully selected to ensure optimal performance and compatibility within the UDS landscape. By integrating functional tools into the platform, UDS ensures that Mission Heroes have access to cutting-edge technologies and best-in-class solutions for their missions.

### Leveraging UDS Applications

Mission Heroes can leverage UDS Core Applications to tailor their mission environment and meet their unique requirements. By selecting and integrating specific tools into their deployments, your team can achieve a streamlined and secure software delivery process. Ranging from setting up a DevSecOps pipeline, enforcing security policies, or managing user identities, UDS Applications provide the necessary tools to accomplish mission objectives effectively.

### UDS Core Dependency

A UDS Core dependency refers to the specific prerequisites and external elements required for the smooth operation of bundled tools. While UDS Applications are designed to offer distinct functionalities, some may necessitate external resources, services, or configurations to seamlessly integrate within a particular environment. These dependencies can include a wide range of components such as databases, security services, and networking tools.
