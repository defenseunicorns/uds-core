## Flavors (Core variants)

This page will describe how different "flavors" of UDS Core (for example, demo vs development vs production‑oriented
profiles) relate to environments and use cases.

It is the place to explain the concept of flavors at a high level, while pointing to Packaging and Reference docs for
specific flavor definitions and technical details.

### Source material from previous docs

Relevant background material from the previous docs includes:

- `src/content/docs-old/reference/deployment/flavors.md`
- `src/content/docs-old/reference/UDS Core/flavor-specific-development-notes.md` (this probably doesn't belong)
