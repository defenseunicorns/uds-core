## Platform layers & environments

This page will describe how UDS Core shapes the platform layer that application workloads run on, and how that maps
onto environments and clusters.

It is the place to explain:

- The high‑level split between the UDS Core platform layer and the application/mission layer.
- How common environments (development, staging, production) are typically represented.
- How different "flavors" of UDS Core fit into that picture.
