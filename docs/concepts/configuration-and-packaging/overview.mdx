## Configuration & packaging

This page will describe how configuration flows through UDS Core:

- UDS Bundles and how they group platform capabilities and mission applications.
- Packages and the "resource tree" model at a high level, with details in Reference.
- Custom resources such as UDS Package and UDS Exemption at a conceptual level.

It should help readers understand where to look when they want to change behavior (bundle vs package vs CRD), before
they dive into specific how‑tos or Reference. From here, readers can also be directed to the dedicated **Packaging**
documentation for deeper authoring and schema details.
