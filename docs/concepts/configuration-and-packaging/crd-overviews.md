## Core CRD overviews

This page will introduce key custom resources used by UDS Core (such as UDS Package and UDS Exemption) and explain, at a
high level, what role each one plays.

Detailed fields and examples will live in Packaging and Reference; this page is only for understanding what each CRD is
for and when platform engineers are likely to interact with it.
