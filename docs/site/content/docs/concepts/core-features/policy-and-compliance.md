## Policy & compliance in UDS Core

UDS Core uses policy and admission control to enforce secure and compliant defaults.

This page will cover the conceptual model for:

- Pepr policies and how they relate to workloads.
- How exemptions work and when they are appropriate.
- How compliance‑as‑code approaches can be layered on top of UDS Core.
