## UDS Core concepts

This section explains how UDS Core works under the hood and how its major pieces fit together.

At a high level, Concepts is organized into three parts:

- **Platform layers & environments** – How the UDS Core platform layer relates to application workloads and common
  environments.
- **Configuration & packaging** – How bundles, packages, and core custom resources relate to each other and to
  external Packaging docs.
- **Core features** – Capability‑focused overviews for the main feature areas (service mesh, identity, logging,
  monitoring, runtime security, backup & restore, policy & compliance).

Use these pages when you need to understand **what** UDS Core is doing and **why**, before changing configuration or
operational practices. For step‑by‑step changes, see How‑to Guides and Reference.
