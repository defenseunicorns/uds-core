## Platform vs application layer

This page will explain the conceptual divide between the UDS Core platform layer and the mission/application layer that
runs on top of it.

It should clarify which responsibilities belong to the platform team (Core, shared services, security controls) and
which belong to application teams (workloads, app configuration), without going into low‑level Kubernetes details.
