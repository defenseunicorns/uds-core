## Environments and clusters

This page will describe how to think about UDS Core across multiple environments (for example, development, staging,
and production) and the clusters that back them.

It is the place to capture guidance on common setups (separate clusters per environment, shared vs dedicated admin
clusters, and so on) without going into provider‑specific details.
