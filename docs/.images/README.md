# UDS Core Diagrams

## Diagram Explanations
At this time there are three layers to our diagram that visually explain the following:

1. `Overview`, basic view of what applications are present and what other services/applications they are communicating with.

2. `Traffic Direction`, similar to `Overview` layer with the addition of directional arrows to represent the flow of traffic in cluster.

3. `Ports and Protocols`, similar to `Traffic Direction` layer with the addition of ports and protocols.

## How to Customize
To customize the diagram, download the svg and in [draw.io](https://draw.io) create a new diagram and load in the svg.

To download the [svg from github](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/tree/main/docs/.images), select one of the svg files, then select the download button in the top right of the `Preview` view.

Alternatively you can also download the svg from the [uds.defenseunicorns.com](https://uds.defenseunicorns.com/reference/uds-core/overview/) docsite by right clicking and selecting the `Save image as` option.

It doesn't matter which svg you download, they all contain the metadata for the other layers mentioned above (you may need to enable the layers pop up in [draw.io](https://draw.io) to change your layer).


#### If you have suggestions for the diagrams, we welcome issues or pull requests contributions to [uds-core](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core).
