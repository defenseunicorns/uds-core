# UDS Core Diagrams

## Diagram Explanations
At this time there are three layers to our diagram that visually explain the following:

1. `Overview`, basic view of what applications are present and what other services/applications they are communicating with.

2. `Traffic Direction`, similar to `Overview` layer with the addition of directional arrows to represent the flow of traffic in cluster.

3. `Ports and Protocols`, similar to `Traffic Direction` layer with the addition of ports and protocols.
