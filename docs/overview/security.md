## Defense‑in‑depth at a glance

This page should give a **high‑level summary** of UDS Core’s security posture. It should outline, without deep
configuration detail:

- Secure supply chain and SBOM/CVE practices.
- Airgap‑ready operation and offline assumptions.
- Identity & single sign‑on.
- Zero‑trust networking and service mesh.
- Admission control and policy.
- Runtime security.
- Observability and audit.

Each theme here should link to deeper Concept and Reference pages for the specific capability area.
