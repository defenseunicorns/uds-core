title: UDS Ecosystem
---

## What is UDS?

This page should give a concise, product-level overview of the broader UDS ecosystem, not just UDS Core. At a high
level, it should cover:

- What UDS is and what kinds of problems it solves (portable, authorizable environments; operating in airgapped or
  constrained networks; avoiding one-off platforms).
- How UDS relates to mission capabilities, bundles, and environments without going into implementation detail.

## Key building blocks

This section should briefly introduce the main moving pieces and link to more detailed docs:

- UDS Core as the runtime platform (with a link to the UDS Core overview page).
- UDS Bundles and packages as the primary delivery mechanism.
- The UDS CLI as the user’s primary interface.

## Who is this documentation for?

This section should clarify who the UDS Core docs are aimed at (platform/infra engineers, security/compliance
stakeholders) and set expectations for application teams that will consume UDS-backed environments.

From here, readers should be directed to the **UDS Core overview** for runtime details and to **Getting Started** to
actually try UDS Core.
