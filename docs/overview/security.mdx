## Defense-in-Depth at a Glance

UDS Core maintains a defense-in-depth baseline, providing real security across the entire software delivery and runtime process:

- **Secure supply chain** with CVE data and SBOMs for transparent software composition analysis and security audits.
- **Airgap ready** with Zarf packages for predictable, offline deployments in disconnected environments.
- **Zero-trust networking** with default-deny Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy`, Istio STRICT mTLS, and ALLOW-based `AuthorizationPolicy`.
- **Identity & SSO** via Keycloak and Authservice so apps can be protected consistently, whether they natively support authentication or not.
- **Admission control** enforced by Pepr policies (non-root, drop capabilities, block privileged/host access, etc.).
- **Runtime security** with real-time detection and alerting on malicious behavior.
- **Observability & audit**: centralized log collection and shipping, plus metrics and dashboards.

> [!NOTE]
> Security defaults are intentionally restrictive. Operators can loosen controls where needed, but any reduction in the default security posture should be made deliberately and documented.

## Secure Supply Chain

UDS Core ships with transparency baked in:

- **Per-release CVE scanning and SBOMs**: Every Core release includes full SBOMs and CVE scan results, available in the UDS Registry. You can verify exactly what ships with each release.
- **Deterministic packaging**: Zarf packages include only what is needed for your environment, reducing drift and surprise dependencies.
- **Open-source foundations**: All components are well-known, auditable open-source projects with active communities and security disclosure processes.

> [!NOTE]
> **Why it matters:** You have full visibility into what you are running. Transparent software composition analysis helps identify and mitigate security risks before deployment.

## Airgap Ready

UDS Core is built from the ground up for disconnected operation:

- **No external runtime dependencies**: All components operate without internet access after deployment.
- **Zarf-powered offline delivery**: Packages carry all images and manifests needed to install and upgrade in an air-gapped cluster.
- **Designed for constrained networks**: Unlike tools that require adaptation for airgapped environments, UDS assumes disconnected operation as the default.

> [!NOTE]
> **Why it matters:** You can deploy and operate securely in classified or offline environments without introducing network backdoors or hidden dependencies.

## Identity & Single Sign-On

UDS Core provides centralized identity management through Keycloak and Authservice:

- **Keycloak SSO** with opinionated defaults for realms, clients, and group-based access control.
- **Authservice integration** protects applications that do not natively support OIDC—enforced at the mesh edge rather than relying on application-level controls.
- **Consistent login, token handling, and group mapping** across all applications running on the platform.

> [!NOTE]
> **Why it matters:** Access control is centralized and auditable. Applications get authentication and authorization enforcement without having to implement it themselves.

## Zero-Trust Networking & Service Mesh

UDS Core implements a zero-trust networking model by default:

- **Default-deny network posture**: Per-namespace `NetworkPolicy` isolates workloads. Connectivity is explicitly allowed based on what each package declares it needs.
- **Istio STRICT mTLS**: All in-mesh traffic is encrypted and identity-authenticated. There is no plaintext service-to-service communication.
- **ALLOW-based authorization**: `AuthorizationPolicy` enforces least privilege at the service layer.
- **Explicit egress**: Outbound access to both in-cluster endpoints and remote hosts must be declared in the package definition.
- **Admin vs. tenant ingress**: Administrative UIs are isolated behind a dedicated gateway, separate from application traffic.

> [!NOTE]
> **Why it matters:** Lateral movement is constrained by both the Kubernetes networking layer and Istio. What your application can talk to is explicit and reviewable.

## Admission Control

Pepr enforces admission policies that prevent misconfigured or overly permissive workloads from reaching the cluster:

- **Secure defaults** block workloads running as root, requesting excess capabilities, or enabling privileged or host access.
- **Security mutations** automatically downgrade workloads to more secure configurations where possible.
- **Controlled exemptions** allow edge cases to be handled explicitly, keeping changes auditable and reviewable.

> [!NOTE]
> **Why it matters:** Misconfigurations are caught at admission time, before they can affect the running cluster. Exemptions are an explicit audit trail, not silent bypasses.

## Runtime Security

Falco provides real-time threat detection for running workloads:

- **Behavioral detection**: Falco monitors process, network, and file activity against rule sets tailored for Kubernetes and container environments.
- **Alerts integrated with observability**: Security events route to your existing logging and metrics stack, not a separate silo.
- **Detection without blocking**: Falco identifies suspicious behavior and alerts operators without risking false-positive outages in production traffic.

> [!NOTE]
> **Why it matters:** Malicious or anomalous behavior is detected immediately, enabling fast triage and response.

## Observability & Audit

UDS Core's observability stack doubles as an audit and compliance tool:

- **Centralized logging**: Vector collects and ships logs from all cluster workloads to Loki, providing a searchable audit trail of application and platform activity.
- **Metrics & dashboards**: Prometheus scrapes cluster and application metrics; Grafana provides pre-wired dashboards for both operational visibility and compliance reporting.
- **Unified troubleshooting**: Logs and metrics are surfaced together, reducing mean time to resolution for security incidents.

> [!NOTE]
> **Why it matters:** Unified observability across logs and metrics means faster diagnosis during both security incidents and routine troubleshooting.
