## What is UDS Core?

UDS Core is the runtime platform layer of the UDS ecosystem. It gives every application deployed on top of it a consistent, secure, and compliance-ready operating environment—so platform engineers do not have to rebuild those concerns for each project.

Think of UDS Core as the foundation a UDS Bundle sits on. It provides shared platform services (identity, networking, logging, monitoring, runtime security, and more) with hardened defaults, and it integrates those services automatically with applications that declare their needs through the UDS Package custom resource.

UDS Core is designed for teams operating in demanding environments: air-gapped networks, classified enclaves, multi-cluster deployments, and edge systems where internet connectivity cannot be assumed.

## Security Posture

Security is built into UDS Core by default, not bolted on. The platform provides defense-in-depth across the software supply chain, network, identity, and runtime layers:

- Secure supply chain with per-release CVE scans and SBOMs.
- Airgap-native operation with no runtime external dependencies.
- Zero-trust networking with default-deny network policies and Istio STRICT mTLS.
- Centralized identity and SSO enforced at the mesh edge.
- Admission control that blocks overly permissive workloads before they reach the cluster.
- Runtime detection and alerting for malicious behavior.
- Centralized logging and metrics for audit and incident response.
