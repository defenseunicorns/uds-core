## What is UDS Core?

This section should briefly explain UDS Core as the runtime platform within the broader UDS ecosystem. It should
describe, at a high level:

- What UDS Core provides for platform engineers (secure runtime, shared services, compliance posture).
- How it relates to UDS Bundles and other ecosystem components introduced in **What is UDS?**

## Key capabilities by feature area

This section should summarize the major capability areas that appear throughout the docs (service mesh, identity,
logging, observability, runtime security, backup & restore, policy & compliance) and point readers to the Concepts and
How‑to sections where those capabilities are explained in depth.

## Security posture

This section should give a high‑level summary of the defense‑in‑depth posture of UDS Core (secure supply chain,
airgap‑ready operation, zero‑trust networking, identity & SSO, policy, logging/metrics) and link to the dedicated
Security overview page and Concepts/Reference for details.

## Where to go next

This section should route readers based on their goals, for example:

- Try UDS Core → **Getting Started** (demo or production path).
- Understand how a particular capability works → **Concepts**.
- Configure or operate a capability → **How‑to Guides**.
- Look up exact configuration fields → **Reference**.
