## What is UDS?

The Unicorn Delivery Service (UDS) is a software delivery platform built for teams operating in secure, constrained, or disconnected environments. It addresses a common challenge in defense and enterprise computing: getting modern software—with all its dependencies—into environments where internet access is limited or absent, compliance requirements are strict, and one-off platform configurations are a constant maintenance burden.

UDS provides a consistent, repeatable way to package, deliver, and run software across cloud, on-premises, and tactical edge environments. Whether you are standing up a new system quickly, maintaining an existing platform through software updates, or seeking an Authority to Operate (ATO), UDS gives teams the tooling and evidence to do so with confidence.

With UDS, platform and mission teams can:

- **Deploy anywhere**: Ship software to classified and unclassified cloud, on-premises, and edge environments from a single artifact.
- **Work disconnected**: Operate fully offline with airgap-native packaging that carries all dependencies with it.
- **Reduce platform one-offs**: Share a common runtime baseline so application teams do not need to reinvent platform concerns for each deployment.
- **Support authorization**: Produce the compliance documentation and evidence needed to facilitate ATO processes.
- **Stay vendor-neutral**: Build on open-source foundations (Zarf, Pepr) with no proprietary lock-in.

## Key Building Blocks

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="UDS Core" icon="rocket">
    The runtime platform that provides shared, security-hardened services to every application deployed on top of it.
    It handles networking, identity, logging, monitoring, runtime security, backup, and compliance—so application
    teams can focus on their software rather than the environment.

    <LinkCard title="Learn about UDS Core" href="/overview/uds-core/" />
  </Card>

  <Card title="UDS CLI" icon="laptop">
    The primary user interface for the UDS platform. It provides tools for packaging, deploying, and managing
    software on UDS Core—designed to be intuitive and flexible, supporting workflows from local development to
    production operations.

    <LinkCard title="CLI Reference" href="/reference/cli/" />
  </Card>

  <Card title="UDS Registry" icon="star">
    A curated catalog of pre-built, scanned, and SBOMed UDS packages. The Registry gives teams a validated
    starting point—browse available packages, inspect CVE reports, and pull artifacts to deploy.

    <LinkCard title="UDS Registry" href="https://registry.defenseunicorns.com/" />
  </Card>

  <Card title="Open-Source Foundation" icon="open-book">
    UDS is built on open-source projects created by Defense Unicorns:

    **[Zarf](https://docs.zarf.dev/)** — Airgap packaging and delivery for Kubernetes workloads.

    **[Pepr](https://docs.pepr.dev/)** — Policy engine and Kubernetes operator automation.
