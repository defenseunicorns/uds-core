## System Requirements

In order to complete this tutorial on macOS or Linux, your Docker Desktop/VM/WSL environment must have at least:
- 4 CPU cores
- 10 GiB RAM
- ~40 GiB free storage

These are absolute minimums to schedule all components. More resources improve responsiveness.

Windows Users running Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) will require an even more powerful setup. It is advised that
your system has the following:

- At least 18GB of RAM
- At least 8 or more CPU cores

WSL has access to 50% of the host machine's available RAM (e.g. 32GB allows WSL access to 16GB), and 100% of its
available CPUs.

> [!NOTE]
> WSL's resource allocation defaults can be changed with the creation of a `.wslconfig` or `wsl.config`.

Optional, but recommended are the following, as they're used in other examples and tutorials:
- A code editor of your choice
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)
- A graphical Kubernetes cluster management tool, such as:
    - [K9s](https://k9scli.io/)
    - [Kubernetes for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools)
    - [Lens](https://k8slens.dev/) (non-free at companies over $10m in revenue)

If you don't have any of these, you can continue with the following setup guides to install these tools or verify that
you have everything you need.

## Setup Guides

#### Install Docker Desktop

If you've done development with Docker in the past, you may already have it installed. If you do, you can likely
skip the rest of this step.

> [!NOTE]
> Use of Docker Desktop at a company with greater than 250 employees or $10 million in annual revenue requires a
paid subscription. If you don't wish to use Docker Desktop as a result, we would recommend an alternative
platform such as [colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima), which is free and open-source.

Visit the [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) website. (Linux users see the Note
below) and select the correct download version for the Docker Desktop based on your computer's OS.  Once the
installer is downloaded, navigate to the location it downloaded (usually the Downloads folder) and
install Docker Desktop.

> [!NOTE]
> Docker Desktop support on Linux is not as extensive as macOS, and at the time of this writing, the latest Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is not yet supported. Due to a change in how the latest Ubuntu release restricts the unprivileged namespaces, `sudo sysctl -w kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0` needs to be run at least once. Refer to the Ubuntu Blog for more details.

All of the above said, you do not have to run Docker Desktop on Linux, and can instead install Docker Engine.

After installation, you can follow OS-specific steps below.


### OS-specific steps
<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="macOS">
        **1. Install Homebrew**

        [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a widely used package manager for macOS which also works with Linux. You can
        install it via the following terminal command:

        ```bash
        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
        ```

        **2. Install k3d**

        For getting started quickly, we recommend using [k3d](https://k3d.io/), a lightweight wrapper for
        [k3s](https://github.com/rancher/k3s), which is Rancher Lab's minimal Kubernetes distribution. k3d's site
        contains detailed installation instructions, but if you're using Homebrew, you can easily install it with a
        simple command:

        ```bash
        brew install k3d
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Linux">
        **1. Install Homebrew**

        [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a widely used package manager for macOS, although it  also works with Linux.
        You can install it via the following terminal command:

        ```bash
        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
        ```

        After installation, you'll need to ensure the `brew` command is added to your PATH. The installer should tell
        you how to do this, and the command should look similar to the following:

        ```bash
        `(echo; echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> /home/[USERNAME]/.bashrc`
        ```

        You will also need to install Homebrew's dependencies:

        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install build-essential
        ```

        Lastly, it's recommended to install GCC:

        ```bash
        brew install gcc
        ```

        **2. Install k3d**

        For getting started quickly, we recommend using [k3d](https://k3d.io/), a lightweight wrapper for

        simple command:

        ```bash
        brew install k3d
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Windows">
        > [!CAUTION]
        > Your computer needs to be running Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11.
        > If you are on an older build, there are manual installation steps for older versions of WSL available
        [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual).

        #### Overview
        We will be following [Install WSL | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for
        compatible Windows builds. However, the Microsoft instructions will provide more details if needed and will be
        more up-to-date over time.

        #### WSL --install
        If you are running Windows at or above the mentioned Builds, we can use the WSL --install command.

        Open PowerShell and run this command:
        `wsl --install`

        The `--install` argument performs the following actions:

        - Enables the optional WSL and Virtual Machine Platform components.
        - Downloads and installs the latest Linux kernel.
        - Sets WSL 2 as the default.
        - Downloads and installs the Ubuntu Linux distribution (reboot may be required).

        Once the --install command is complete, you will be asked to restart your computer. After the restart, a
        terminal should open and ask you to create a username and password. If the terminal does not open, we can select
        the start menu and search for and select Ubuntu to open its terminal. Once the terminal opens, it will ask us to
        create a Username and Password for Linux. Go ahead and do that.

        Now that we have WSL working and have installed Ubuntu let's do some Linux housekeeping and run the following
        command in the Ubuntu terminal:

        `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`

        > [!CAUTION]
        > Based on end user reports you may need to be on a Linux kernel version of 6.6.x+ in order to have the required kernel modules for Istio (see [prerequisite documentation](https://uds.defenseunicorns.com/reference/uds-core/prerequisites/#istio)).
        > You can update your kernel to the latest prerelease version using `wsl --update --pre-release`.

        #### WSL Configurations
        By default, WSL will have access 100% of your system's CPU cores and 50% of your memory/RAM.  If you need to
        increase the available memory/RAM or change configurations, you will need to create a `.wslconfig` or wsl.config
        by following [these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config)

        ```
        Example .wslconfig

        [ws12]
        memory=25GB

        ```

        #### End Of WSL installation and Setup
        From this point on, the paths for Windows WSL and macOS converge. The next step is to install Docker Desktop.

        #### Troubleshooting WSL
        If you're having issues with WSL, you can try some of the following:

        - **Check your BIOS Settings**

            If Ubuntu does not start up, you may need to enable virtualization in your BIOS.
            - This will require entering the BIOS for your machine and enabling virtualization. An online search can
            help you find instructions on how to do this. If you're on a work computer, you'll need to have access to
            the BIOS settings, which may require a password or a system administrator who can do it for you.
        - **Verify that Windows features are enabled**

            From the start menu, search `turn Windows features on or off`.
            The following features should have a checked box:
            - Virtual Machine Platform
            - Windows Subsystem for Linux
        - **Check what version of WSL is running**

            Run `wsl -l -v` in a PowerShell or Windows Terminal prompt. If Ubuntu has a `1` listed under `VERSION`,
            change it to a 2:

            `wsl --set-version [distro name] 2` (replacing [distro name]) with the name of the Linux distribution.
        - **Run Windows as a VM**

            - If you're running Windows in a VM, you need to enable nested virtualization. This is a hardware-specific
            feature and needs to be enabled in your BIOS settings for the host machine and in the Hypervisor software
            you're running. Not all CPUs or Hypervisor software support nested virtualization.


        > [!TIP]
        > If you need to update the WSL kernel, use this command:
        > `wsl --update`
