## Local demo quickstart

Use this path to spin up UDS Core on a local/demo cluster for evaluation and experimentation.

This is **not** intended for production use.

### Next steps

- Read [Basic requirements](/getting-started/local-demo/basic-requirements/) to verify your local environment.
- Then follow [Install and deploy UDS](/getting-started/local-demo/install-and-deploy-uds/) to bring up the demo bundle.

If you want to go further, you can then [integrate your own package into the demo](/getting-started/local-demo/integrate-your-package/).

### Source material from previous docs

This path is based on the previous Getting Started flow:

- `src/content/docs-old/getting-started/basic-requirements.mdx`
- `src/content/docs-old/getting-started/install-and-deploy-uds.md`
