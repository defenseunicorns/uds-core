## Integrate your own package into the demo

This page will walk through creating a simple UDS package and adding it to the local demo bundle so you can see how
package authoring and integration works end-to-end.

It is a continuation of the local demo path and is aimed at users who have already brought up the demo cluster and now
want to try wiring in their own workload.
