UDS Core leverages [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) and [Authservice](https://github.com/istio-ecosystem/authservice) to implify authentication and authorization for applications. These tools enable seamless user authentication experiences while supporting various OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) flows.

UDS Core automates Keycloak Client configuration, secret management, and advanced templating, offering scalable support for a wide range of applications and authentication scenarios. The chart below illustrates the basic logical connection between these concepts:

When a new UDS Package CR with the `sso` configuration gets deployed, the UDS Operator creates a new Keycloak Client. This process happens in one of two modes - using [Dynamic Client Registration](https://www.keycloak.org/securing-apps/client-registration) or [Keycloak Admin endpoint](https://www.keycloak.org/docs-api/latest/rest-api/index.html#_clients) for managing Clients. Depending on the Keycloak Realm configuration, the Operator automatically picks the right mode. In the case of the former mode, the Registration Token that is used for updating and removing the newly created Keycloak Client is stored in Pepr Store. The latter mode reads the Client Secrets from the `keycloak-client-secrets` Kubernetes Secret deployed in `keycloak` namespace. This Secret is managed automatically by the UDS Operator. Once the Keycloak Client is ready, and the `enableAuthserviceSelector` is defined in the spec, the UDS Operator deploys Istio [Request Authentication](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/security/request_authentication/) and [AuthorizationPolicy](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/security/authorization-policy/) for both JWT and Request Headers. Both actions combined, enables seamless and transparent application authentication and authorization capabilities. 

## Rotating the UDS Operator Client Secret

The UDS Operator uses a dedicated Client in Keycloak. In some cases, the Client Secret needs to be rotated. In order to do so, you need to manually modify the `keycloak-client-secrets` Kubernetes Secret in the `keycloak` namespace and delete the `uds-operator` key. The UDS Operator will automatically re-create it. 

## User Groups

UDS Core deploys Keycloak which has some preconfigured groups that applications inherit from SSO and IDP configurations. More details might be found in the [Package CR](/reference/configuration/custom-resources/packages-v1alpha1-cr/#groups) spec.

### Applications

#### Grafana

Grafana [maps the groups](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/49cb11a058a9209cee7019fa552b8c0b2ef73368/src/grafana/values/values.yaml#L37) from Keycloak to its internal `Admin` and `Viewer` groups.

| Keycloak Group | Mapped Grafana Group |
|----------------|----------------------|
| `Admin`        | `Admin`              |
| `Auditor`      | `Viewer`             |

If a user doesn't belong to either of these Keycloak groups the user will be unauthorized when accessing Grafana.

#### Neuvector

Neuvector [maps the groups](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/main/src/neuvector/chart/templates/uds-package.yaml#L31-L35) from Keycloak to its internal `admin` and `reader` groups.

| Keycloak Group | Mapped Neuvector Group |
|----------------|------------------------|
| `Admin`        | `admin`                |
| `Auditor`      | `reader`               |

#### Keycloak

All groups are under the Uds Core parent group. Frequently a group will be referred to as Uds Core/Admin or Uds Core/Auditor. In the Keycloak UI this requires an additional click to get down to the sub groups.
