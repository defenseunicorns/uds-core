UDS Core leverages [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) and [Authservice](https://github.com/istio-ecosystem/authservice) to implify authentication and authorization for applications. These tools enable seamless user authentication experiences while supporting various OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) flows.

UDS Core automates Keycloak Client configuration, secret management, and advanced templating, offering scalable support for a wide range of applications and authentication scenarios. You can learn more about these concepts [here](/reference/uds-core/idam/uds-identity-config-overview/).
