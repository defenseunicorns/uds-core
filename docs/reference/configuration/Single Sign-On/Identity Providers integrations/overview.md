UDS Core utilizes [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) to simplify identity brokering, enabling seamless integration
with external identity providers through industry-standard protocols such as SAML, OAuth 2.0, and OpenID Connect (OIDC).
This functionality allows users to authenticate using their existing credentials from third-party services.

The identity brokering process by automating provider configuration, managing
dependencies, and supporting advanced customization options. For more details, refer to
the [Identity Brokering documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#_identity_broker).
