title: Authservice Protection
---

To enable authentication for applications that do not have native OIDC configuration, UDS Core can utilize Authservice as an authentication layer.

Follow these steps to protect your application with Authservice:

* Set `enableAuthserviceSelector` with a matching label selector in the `sso` configuration of the Package.
* Ensure that the pods of the application are labeled with the corresponding selector or use an empty selector to protect all of them

```yaml
apiVersion: uds.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Package
metadata:
  name: httpbin
  namespace: httpbin
spec:
  sso:
    - name: Demo SSO httpbin
      clientId: uds-core-httpbin
      redirectUris:
        - "https://httpbin.uds.dev/login"
      enableAuthserviceSelector:
        app: httpbin
```

:::note
The UDS Operator uses the first `redirectUris` to populate the `match.prefix` hostname and `callback_uri` in the authservice chain.
