## Keycloak Customization Guide

UDS Core provides three distinct approaches for customizing Keycloak, each serving different needs:

1. **Helm Chart Values** - Configure operational settings and simple branding via bundle overrides
2. **UDS Identity Config Image** - Add custom code, themes, and plugins by building a custom image
3. **OpenTofu/IaC** - Manage Keycloak resources (auth flows, identity providers, groups, users) declaratively after deployment

This guide helps you choose the right approach for your customization needs.

 **For detailed implementation instructions**, see the [UDS Identity Config Customization Guide](https://uds.defenseunicorns.com/reference/uds-core/idam/customization/).

## Customization Approaches

### Approach 1: Helm Chart Values

**Use for**: Configuration changes that don't require custom code, anything in the [chart values](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/main/src/keycloak/chart/values.yaml)

**Examples**:
- Scaling replicas or adjusting resources
- Configuring session timeouts
- Enabling/disabling authentication methods at install time
- Simple branding (logo, favicon, background)

**Key Point**: Changes are applied via UDS bundle overrides and don't require rebuilding images.

```yaml
packages:
  - name: core
    overrides:
      keycloak:
        keycloak:
          values:
            - path: resources.requests.memory
              value: "1Gi"
```

### Approach 2: UDS Identity Config Image

**Use for**: Custom code, themes, plugins, or realm modifications

**Examples**:
- Adding custom authentication providers
- Creating custom themes with HTML/CSS changes
- Installing third-party Keycloak plugins
- Modifying the default realm structure

**Key Point**: Requires building a custom identity-config image from the [uds-identity-config repository](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-identity-config).

**Build and Deploy**: See [Testing and Deployment Customizations](https://uds.defenseunicorns.com/reference/uds-core/idam/testing-deployment-customizations/) for detailed instructions on building custom images, using Zarf packages, and deploying to UDS Core.

```yaml
packages:
  - name: core
    overrides:
      keycloak:
        keycloak:
          values:
            - path: configImage
              value: ghcr.io/your-org/identity-config:1.0.0
```

### Approach 3: OpenTofu / Infrastructure as Code

**Use for**: Managing Keycloak resources declaratively after deployment

**Examples**:
- Managing complex auth flows
- Managing groups and role mappings
- Configuring identity providers
- Automating user provisioning

**Key Point**: Manages running Keycloak resources declaratively in code without redeployment.

### Deployment Flow:
1. **Helm values** configure Keycloak at deployment time
2. **Identity config image** syncs custom files via init container
3. **OpenTofu** manages resources in the running instance

**Key Points**:
- Helm values: Applied at deployment, no image rebuild needed
- Identity config: Requires image rebuild, applied at pod startup
- OpenTofu: Applied to running instance, no redeployment needed

## Choosing the Right Approach

### Choose Helm Chart Values When:
- You need to adjust operational settings (resources, replicas, timeouts)
- You want to enable/disable built-in authentication methods at install time
- You need simple branding changes (logo, favicon, background)
- Changes are environment-specific
- You don't want to rebuild images

### Choose Identity Config Image When:
- You need to add custom Java plugins or libraries
- You want extensive theme customization (HTML/CSS/JS changes)
- You need to modify the default realm structure
- You're adding custom PKI certificates
- You're implementing custom Keycloak SPIs

### Choose OpenTofu/IaC When:
- You need to configure external identity providers (SAML, OIDC, LDAP)
- You want to manage advanced authentication flows post-deployment
- You want to manage Keycloak resources as code
- You need to manage groups, users, and roles declaratively
- You're handling upgrade scenarios with complex configurations

:::note
  OpenTofu is better suited for:
  - Complex identity provider configurations
  - Managing resources during upgrades
  - Advanced configurations not supported by Package CRs
