## CLI reference

This subsection should **not** mirror the autogenerated per-command docs that live with the CLI repo. Those detailed
pages should remain with the CLI and be discoverable via `uds help` and `uds <command> --help`.

Instead, this section should contain a small number of hand-authored reference pages, such as:

- Overall CLI behavior and patterns (configuration, environment variables, exit codes).
- Schema/validation reference and how it relates to bundles/packages.
- A very high-level index of major commands with links back to the CLI repo docs when needed.

If a page is primarily a tutorial ("install the CLI", "first deploy"), it belongs in **Getting Started** or
**How-to Guides**, not here.

### Source material from previous docs

- `src/content/docs-old/reference/CLI/overview.md`
- `src/content/docs-old/reference/CLI/quickstart-and-usage.md` *(mixed: usage/how-to content should move out; only stable behavior belongs here)*
- `src/content/docs-old/reference/CLI/schema-validation.md`
- `src/content/docs-old/reference/CLI/uds-runner.md`
