title: Published Flavors
---

UDS Core is published with multiple variations (Zarf flavors). Each flavor uses a separate source registry for the images. Each flavor is used as the suffix on the OCI tags for packages. For production use cases we recommend the `registry1` or `unicorn` flavors as these images tend to be more secure than their `upstream` counterparts.

:::note
Demo and dev bundles (`k3d-core-demo` and `k3d-core-slim-dev`) are only published from the upstream flavor.
