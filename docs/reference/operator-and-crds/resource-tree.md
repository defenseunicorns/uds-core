## Resource tree reference

This page should describe how the UDS Operator builds and reconciles the resource tree for bundles and packages.

Include here:

- A concise description of the resource tree concept and its role in reconciliation.
- Any stable, referenceable behavior (naming, ownership, status conventions).
- Pointers to Concepts for the mental model and to How-to/Ops for debugging workflows.

### Source material from previous docs

- `src/content/docs-old/reference/configuration/UDS Operator/resource-tree.md` *(mixed; keep reference behavior here, move troubleshooting to Ops)*
