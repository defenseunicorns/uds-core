## Package CR reference

This page should provide field-level reference for the `Package` custom resource used by the UDS Operator.

Include here:

- A high-level summary of the CRD purpose and how it relates to bundles/packages.
- A structured view of the spec fields (sections and important options), not a how-to.
- Links back to Concepts and How-to Guides for workflows that use the Package CR.

### Source material from previous docs

- `src/content/docs-old/reference/configuration/UDS Operator/package.md` *(mixed; keep schema/behavior details here, move step-by-step usage to Concepts/How-to)*
- `src/content/docs-old/reference/configuration/Custom Resources/packages-v1alpha1-cr.md` *(schema reference)*
