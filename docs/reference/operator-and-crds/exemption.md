## Exemption CR reference

This page should provide field-level reference for the `Exemption` custom resource used to request policy exemptions.

Include here:

- A short description of what exemptions are and how they relate to Pepr policies.
- Field descriptions and behavior (what each field controls, defaults, constraints).
- Pointers to policy/How-to docs for the workflows around requesting and approving exemptions.

### Source material from previous docs

- `src/content/docs-old/reference/configuration/UDS Operator/exemption.md` *(mixed; keep schema/behavior details here, move process/how-to elsewhere)*
- `src/content/docs-old/reference/configuration/Custom Resources/exemptions-v1alpha1-cr.md` *(schema reference)*
- `src/content/docs-old/reference/configuration/pepr-policies.md` *(for context only)*
