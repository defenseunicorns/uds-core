## ClusterConfig CR reference

This page should provide field-level reference for the `ClusterConfig` custom resource that describes a UDS Core cluster.

Include here:

- A short description of what ClusterConfig is used for (high-level only).
- Field descriptions: major sections and important configuration knobs.
- Pointers to Concepts and Ops docs for HA, sizing, and lifecycle behavior.

### Source material from previous docs

- `src/content/docs-old/reference/configuration/Custom Resources/clusterconfig-v1alpha1-cr.md` *(schema reference)*
- `src/content/docs-old/reference/configuration/uds-cluster-configuration.md` *(mixed; HA/sizing behavior may live in Ops/Concepts)*
