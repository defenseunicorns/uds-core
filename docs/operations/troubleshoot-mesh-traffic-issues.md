## Operations & maintenance

Use this section when you are **running and owning** a UDS Core platform over time, not when you are configuring a
single feature or doing a first-time install.

This part of the docs should focus on:

- Day-2 operations: upgrades, HA, capacity, and backup/restore strategies.
- Runbooks and playbooks for common operational scenarios.
- Troubleshooting flows and incident response.

If a page is primarily about configuring a single capability for the first time, it likely belongs in **How-to Guides**.
If it is mostly conceptual background, it belongs in **Concepts**. Ops & maintenance should assume a running platform and
answer "how do we keep it healthy?".
