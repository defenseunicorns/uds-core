## Troubleshooting & runbooks

This page should organize troubleshooting guidance and operational runbooks for UDS Core.

Include here:

- How to approach common classes of issues (bundle deploy failures, SSO problems, mesh/traffic issues).
- Pointers to specific runbook pages (if we add them later) for repeated procedures.
- Guidance on what to collect for incident response (logs, metrics, events).

Detailed configuration steps for features still belong in **How-to Guides**; this section is about diagnosing and
resolving issues on a running platform.

### Source material from previous docs

- `src/content/docs-old/reference/troubleshooting/exemptions-and-package-updates.md` *(mixed; reorganize as runbooks here, move configuration details to How-to/Reference)*
- `src/content/docs-old/reference/troubleshooting/pepr-istiod-webhooks.md` *(bundle/mesh troubleshooting runbook)*
