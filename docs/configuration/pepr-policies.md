## Common Pepr Policies for UDS Core

### Pepr Policy Exemptions {#pepr-policy-exemptions}
These policies are based on the [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/policies/) policies.

Exemptions can be specified by a [UDS Exemption CR](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/v0.27.0/src/pepr/operator/README.md). These take the place of Kyverno Exceptions.

If a resource is exempted, it will be annotated as `uds-core.pepr.dev/uds-core-policies.<POLICY>: exempted`

### Pepr Policy Validations

| Kyverno Policy🔗 | Exemption Validation🔗 | Policy Description |
| ----------------- | :--------------------: | ------------------ |
| [Disallow Host Namespaces](https://kyverno.io/policies/pod-security/baseline/disallow-host-namespaces/disallow-host-namespaces/) | [`DisallowHostNamespaces`](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/v0.27.0/src/pepr/policies/networking.ts#L7-L35) | Subject: **Pod** <br> Severity: **high** <br><br> Host namespaces (Process ID namespace, Inter-Process Communication namespace, and network namespace) allow access to shared information and can be used to elevate privileges. Pods should not be allowed access to host namespaces. This policy ensures fields which make use of these host namespaces are set to `false`. |
|[Disallow NodePort Services](https://kyverno.io/policies/best-practices/restrict-node-port/restrict-node-port/) | [`DisallowNodePortServices`](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/v0.27.0/src/pepr/policies/networking.ts#L88-L110) | Subject: **Service** <br> Severity: **medium** <br><br> A Kubernetes Service of type NodePort uses a host port to receive traffic from any source. A NetworkPolicy cannot be used to control traffic to host ports. Although NodePort Services can be useful, their use must be limited to Services with additional upstream security checks. This policy validates that any new Services do not use the `NodePort` type. |
|[Disallow Privilege Escalation](https://kyverno.io/policies/pod-security/restricted/disallow-privilege-escalation/disallow-privilege-escalation/) | [`DisallowPrivileged`](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/v0.27.0/src/pepr/policies/security.ts#L14-L75) | Subject: **Pod** <br> Severity: **high** <br><br> Privilege escalation, such as via set-user-ID or set-group-ID file mode, should not be allowed. This policy ensures the `allowPrivilegeEscalation` fields are either undefined or set to `false`. |
|[Disallow Privileged Containers](https://kyverno.io/policies/pod-security/baseline/disallow-privileged-containers/disallow-privileged-containers/) | [`DisallowPrivileged`](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/v0.27.0/src/pepr/policies/security.ts#L14-L75) | Subject: **Pod** <br> Severity: **high** <br><br> Privileged mode disables most security mechanisms and must not be allowed. This policy ensures Pods do not call for privileged mode. |
|[Disallow SELinux Options](https://kyverno.io/policies/pod-security/baseline/disallow-selinux/disallow-selinux/) | [`DisallowSELinuxOptions`](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/v0.27.0/src/pepr/policies/security.ts#L244-L285) | Subject: **Pod** <br> Severity: **high** <br><br> SELinux options can be used to escalate privileges. This policy ensures that the `seLinuxOptions` specified are not used. |
|[Drop All Capabilities](https://kyverno.io/policies/best-practices/require-drop-all/require-drop-all/) | [`DropAllCapabilities`](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/v0.27.0/src/pepr/policies/security.ts#L329-L376) | Subject: **Pod** <br> Severity: **medium** <br><br> Capabilities permit privileged actions without giving full root access. All capabilities should be dropped from a Pod, with only those required added back. This policy ensures that all containers explicitly specify `drop: ["ALL"]`. |
|[Require Non-root User](https://kyverno.io/policies/pod-security/restricted/require-run-as-non-root-user/require-run-as-non-root-user/) | [`RequireNonRootUser`](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/v0.27.0/src/pepr/policies/security.ts#L77-L167) | Subject: **Pod** <br> Severity: **high** <br><br> Following the least privilege principle, containers should not be run as root. This policy ensures containers either have `runAsNonRoot` set to `true` or `runAsUser` > 0. |
|[Restrict Capabilities](https://kyverno.io/policies/pod-security/baseline/disallow-capabilities/disallow-capabilities/) | [`RestrictCapabilities`](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/v0.27.0/src/pepr/policies/security.ts#L378-L413) | Subject: **Pod** <br> Severity: **high** <br><br> Capabilities permit privileged actions without giving full root access. Adding capabilities beyond the default set must not be allowed. This policy ensures users cannot add additional capabilities beyond the allowed list to a Pod. |
|[Restrict External Names (CVE-2020-8554)](https://kyverno.io/policies/best-practices/restrict-service-external-ips/restrict-service-external-ips/) | [`RestrictExternalNames`](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/v0.27.0/src/pepr/policies/networking.ts#L67-L86) | Subject: **Service** <br> Severity: **medium** <br><br> Service external names can be used for a MITM attack (CVE-2020-8554). External names can be used by an attacker to point back to localhost or internal IP addresses for exploitation. This policy restricts services using external names to a specified list. |
|[Restrict hostPath Volume Writable Paths](https://kyverno.io/policies/other/ensure-readonly-hostpath/ensure-readonly-hostpath/) | [`RestrictHostPathWrite`](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/v0.27.0/src/pepr/policies/storage.ts#L54-L92) | Subject: **Pod** <br> Severity: **medium** <br><br> hostPath volumes consume the underlying node's file system. If hostPath volumes are not universally disabled, they should be required to be read-only. Pods which are allowed to mount hostPath volumes in read/write mode pose a security risk even if confined to a "safe" file system on the host and may escape those confines. This policy checks containers for hostPath volumes and validates they are explicitly mounted in readOnly mode. |
|[Restrict Host Ports](https://kyverno.io/policies/pod-security/baseline/disallow-host-ports/disallow-host-ports/) | [`RestrictHostPorts`](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/v0.27.0/src/pepr/policies/networking.ts#L37-L65) | Subject: **Pod** <br> Severity: **high** <br><br> Access to host ports allows potential snooping of network traffic and should not be allowed, or at minimum restricted to a known list. This policy ensures only approved ports are defined in container's `hostPort` field. |
|[Restrict Proc Mount](https://kyverno.io/policies/pod-security/baseline/disallow-proc-mount/disallow-proc-mount/) | [`RestrictProcMount`](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/v0.27.0/src/pepr/policies/security.ts#L169-L198) | Subject: **Pod** <br> Severity: **high** <br><br> The default /proc masks are set up to reduce the attack surface. This policy ensures nothing but the specified procMount can be used. By default only "Default" is allowed. |
|[Restrict Seccomp](https://kyverno.io/policies/pod-security/baseline/restrict-seccomp/restrict-seccomp/) | [`RestrictSeccomp`](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/v0.27.0/src/pepr/policies/security.ts#L200-L242) | Subject: **Pod** <br> Severity: **high** <br><br> The SecComp profile should not be explicitly set to Unconfined. This policy, requiring Kubernetes v1.19 or later, ensures that the `seccompProfile.Type` is undefined or restricted to the values in the allowed list. By default, this is `RuntimeDefault` or `Localhost`. |
|[Restrict SELinux Type](https://kyverno.io/policies/pod-security/baseline/disallow-selinux/disallow-selinux/) | [`RestrictSELinuxType`](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/v0.27.0/src/pepr/policies/security.ts#L287-L327) | Subject: **Pod** <br> Severity: **high** <br><br> SELinux options can be used to escalate privileges. This policy ensures that the `seLinuxOptions` type field is undefined or restricted to the allowed list. |
|[Restrict Volume Types](https://kyverno.io/policies/pod-security/restricted/restrict-volume-types/restrict-volume-types/) | [`RestrictVolumeTypes`](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/v0.27.0/src/pepr/policies/storage.ts#L7-L52) | Subject: **Pod** <br> Severity: **medium** <br><br> Volume types, beyond the core set, should be restricted to limit exposure to potential vulnerabilities in Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers. In addition, HostPath volumes should not be. |

| Pepr Mutation🔗 | Mutated Fields | Mutation Logic |
| --------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| [Disallow Privilege Escalation](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/v0.27.0/src/pepr/policies/security.ts#L14-L75) | `securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation` | Ensures `allowPrivilegeEscalation` is either undefined or set to `false`. Conditions: the field is undefined, the container is not privileged, and `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` is not added. |
| [Disallow Privileged Containers](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/v0.27.0/src/pepr/policies/security.ts#L14-L75) | `securityContext.privileged` | Ensures that the container does not run in privileged mode by setting `securityContext.privileged` to `false`. |
| [Require Non-root User](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/v0.27.0/src/pepr/policies/security.ts#L77-L167) | `securityContext.runAsUser`,<br> `securityContext.runAsGroup`,<br> `securityContext.fsGroup`,<br> `securityContext.runAsNonRoot` | User can define the values for `uds/user`, `uds/group`, `uds/fsgroup` through metadata labels. Defaults to `runAsUser: 1000`, `runAsGroup: 1000`, and `runAsNonRoot: true` if not provided. |
| [Drop All Capabilities](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core/blob/v0.27.0/src/pepr/policies/security.ts#L329-L376) | `securityContext.capabilities.drop` | Ensures all capabilities are dropped by setting `capabilities.drop` to `["ALL"]` for all containers. |
