## Developer Experience

Continuous Delivery is core to our development philosophy. Check out [https://minimumcd.org](https://minimumcd.org) for a good baseline agreement on what that means.

Specifically:

* We do trunk-based development (main) with short-lived feature branches that originate from the trunk, get merged into the trunk, and are deleted after the merge
* We don't merge code into main that isn't releasable
* We perform automated testing on all changes before they get merged to main
* Continuous integration (CI) pipeline tests are definitive
* We create immutable release artifacts

## Definition of Done

We apply these general principles to all User Stories and activities contributing to the UDS.

* Automated continuous integration (CI) pipeline tests pass
* CI pipeline tests have been updated to meet system changes
* Changes are peer reviewed
* Acceptance criteria is met
* Documentation is updated to reflect what changed

## Getting Started
